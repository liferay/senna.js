  /**
   * Promises provide a result that may be resolved asynchronously. A Promise may
   * be resolved by being fulfilled or rejected with a value, which will be known
   * as the fulfillment value or the rejection reason. Whether fulfilled or
   * rejected, the Promise result is immutable once it is set.
   *
   * Promises may represent results of any type, including undefined. Rejection
   * reasons are typically Errors, but may also be of any type. Closure Promises
   * allow for optional type annotations that enforce that fulfillment values are
   * of the appropriate types at compile time.
   *
   * The result of a Promise is accessible by calling {@code then} and registering
   * {@code onFulfilled} and {@code onRejected} callbacks. Once the Promise
   * resolves, the relevant callbacks are invoked with the fulfillment value or
   * rejection reason as argument. Callbacks are always invoked in the order they
   * were registered, even when additional {@code then} calls are made from inside
   * another callback. A callback is always run asynchronously sometime after the
   * scope containing the registering {@code then} invocation has returned.
   *
   * If a Promise is resolved with another Promise, the first Promise will block
   * until the second is resolved, and then assumes the same result as the second
   * Promise. This allows Promises to depend on the results of other Promises,
   * linking together multiple asynchronous operations.
   *
   * This implementation is compatible with the Promises/A+ specification and
   * passes that specification's conformance test suite. A Closure Promise may be
   * resolved with a Promise instance (or sufficiently compatible Promise-like
   * object) created by other Promise implementations. From the specification,
   * Promise-like objects are known as "Thenables".
